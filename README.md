# Simulated Self-Driving Car

Go read the blog post if you haven't yet -> https://quirion.io/self-driving-car-in-unity/

I can't upload the entire thing, because it contains copyrighted unity assets.

The script I've uploaded is what takes care of everything related to reinforcement learning.

The rest of the project consists only of assets from the Unity Asset Store and Google Poly.
